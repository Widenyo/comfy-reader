        <h3>THE HISTORY OF THOTH THE ATLANTEAN</h3>
        <span>I, THOTH, the Atlantean, master of mysteries,
            keeper of records, mighty king, magician,
            living from generation to generation,
            being about to pass into the halls of Amenti,
            set down for the guidance of
            those that are to come after,
            these records of the mighty wisdom of Great Atlantis.
            In the great city of KEOR on the island of UNDAL,
            in a time far past, I began this incarnation.
            Not as the little men of the present age did
            the mighty ones of Atlantis live and die,
            but rather from aeon to aeon did they renew
            their life in the Halls of Amenti where the river of life
            flows eternally onward.
            A hundred times ten
            have I descended the dark way that led into light,
            and as many times have I ascended from the
            darkness into the light my strength and power renewed.
            Now for a time I descend,
            and the men of KHEM (Khem is ancient Egypt)
            shall know me no more.
            But in a time yet unborn will I rise again,
            mighty and potent, requiring an accounting
            of those left behind me.
            Then beware, O men of KHEM,
            if ye have falsely betrayed my teaching,
            for I shall cast ye down from your high estate
            into the darkness of the caves from whence ye came.
            Betray not my secrets
            to the men of the North
            or the men of the South
            lest my curse fall upon ye.
            Remember and heed my words,
            for surely will I return again
            and require of thee that which ye guard.
            Aye, even from beyond time and
            from beyond death will I return,
            rewarding or punishing
            as ye have requited your truest.
            Great were my people in the ancient days,
            great beyond the conception of the
            little people now around me;
            knowing the wisdom of old,
            seeking far within the heart of infinity
            knowledge that belonged to Earth's youth.
            Wise were we with the wisdom
            of the Children of Light who dwelt among us.
            Strong were we with the power drawn
            from the eternal fire.
            And of all these, greatest among the
            children of men was my father, THOTME,
            keeper of the great temple,
            link between the Children of Light
            who dwelt within the temple and the
            races of men who inhabited the ten islands.
            Mouthpiece, after the Three,
            of the Dweller of UNAL,
            speaking to the Kings
            with the voice that must be obeyed.
            Grew I there from a child into manhood,
            being taught by my father the elder mysteries,
            until in time there grew within the fire of wisdom,
            until it burst into a consuming flame.
            Naught desired I but the attainment of wisdom.
            Until on a great day the command came from the
            Dweller of the Temple that I be brought before him.
            Few there were among the children of men
            who had looked upon that mighty face and lived,
            for not as the sons of men are the
            Children of Light when they are not incarnate
            in a physical body.
            Chosen was I from the sons of men,
            taught by the Dweller so that his
            purposes might be fulfilled,
            purposes yet unborn in the womb of time.
            Long ages I dwelt in the Temple,
            learning ever and yet ever more wisdom,
            until I, too, approached the light emitted
            from the great fire.
            Taught me he, the path to Amenti,
            the underworld where the great king sits
            upon his throne of might.
            Deep I bowed in homage before the Lords of Life
            and the Lords of Death,
            receiving as my gift the Key of Life.
            Free was I of the Halls of Amenti,
            bound not be death to the circle of life.
            Far to the stars I journeyed until
            space and time became as naught.
            Then having drunk deep of the cup of wisdom,
            I looked into the hearts of men and there found I
            greater mysteries and was glad.
            For only in the Search for Truth could my Soul
            be stilled and the flame within be quenched.
            Down through the ages I lived,
            seeing those around me taste of the cup
            of death and return again in the light of life.
            Gradually from the Kingdoms of Atlantis passed waves
            of consciousness that had been one with me,
            only to be replaced by spawn of a lower star.
            In obedience to the law,
            the word of the Master grew into flower.
            Downward into the darkness turned the
            thoughts of the Atlanteans,
            Until at last in this wrath arose from his AGWANTI,
            the Dweller, (this word has no English equivalent;
            it means a state of detachment)
            speaking The Word, calling the power.
            Deep in Earth's heart, the sons of Amenti heard,
            and hearing, directing the changing of the flower of fire
            that burns eternally, changing and shifting, using the LOGOS,
            until that great fire changed its direction.
            Over the world then broke the great waters,
            drowning and sinking, changing Earth's balance
            until only the Temple of Light was left
            standing on the great mountain on UNDAL
            still rising out of the water;
            some there were who were living,
            saved from the rush of the fountains.
            Called to me then the Master, saying:
            Gather ye together my people.
            Take them by the arts ye have learned of far across the waters,
            until ye reach the land of the hairy barbarians,
            dwelling in caves of the desert.
            Follow there the plan that yet know of.
            Gathered I then my people and
            entered the great ship of the Master.
            Upward we rose into the morning.
            Dark beneath us lay the Temple.
            Suddenly over it rose the waters.
            Vanished from Earth,
            until the time appointed,
            was the great Temple.
            Fast we fled toward the sun of the morning,
            until beneath us lay the land of the children of KHEM.
            Raging, they came with cudgels and spears,
            lifted in anger seeking to slay and utterly destroy the Sons of Atlantis.
            Then raised I my staff and directed a ray of vibration,
            striking them still in their tracks as fragments
            of stone of the mountain.
            Then spoke I to them in words calm and peaceful,
            telling them of the might of Atlantis,
            saying we were children of the Sun and its messengers.
            Cowed I them by my display of magic-science,
            until at my feet they groveled, when I released them.
            Long dwelt we in the land of KHEM,
            long and yet long again.
            Until obeying the commands of the Master,
            who while sleeping yet lives eternally,
            I sent from me the Sons of Atlantis,
            sent them in many directions,
            that from the womb of time wisdom
            might rise again in her children.
            Long time dwelt I in the land of KHEM, doing great works by the wisdom within me.
            Upward grew into the light of knowledge
            the children of KHEM,
            watered by the rains of my wisdom.
            Blasted I then a path to Amenti so
            that I might retain my powers,
            living from age to age a Sun of Atlantis,
            keeping the wisdom, preserving the records.
            Great few the sons of KHEM,
            conquering the people around them,
            growing slowly upwards in Soul force.
            Now for a time I go from among them into
            the dark halls of Amenti,
            deep in the halls of the Earth,
            before the Lords of the powers,
            face to face once again with the Dweller.
            Raised I high over the entrance, a doorway, a gateway
            leading down to Amenti.
            Few there would be with courage to dare it,
            few pass the portal to dark Amenti.
            Raised over the passage, I, a mighty pyramid,
            using the power that overcomes Earth force (gravity).
            Deep and yet deeper place I a force-house or chamber;
            from it carved I a circular passage
            reaching almost to the great summit.
            There in the apex, set I the crystal,
            sending the ray into the "Time-Space,"
            drawing the force from out of the ether,
            concentrating upon the gateway to Amenti.
            Other chambers I built and left vacant to all seeming,
            yet hidden within them are the keys to Amenti.
            He who in courage would dare the dark realms,
            let him be purified first by long fasting.
            Lie in the sarcophagus of stone in my chamber.
            Then reveal I to him the great mysteries.
            Soon shall he follow to where I shall meet him,
            even in the darkness of Earth shall I meet him, I,
            Thoth, Lord of Wisdom, meet him and hold him
            and dwell with him always. Builded I the Great Pyramid,
            patterned after the pyramid of Earth force,
            burning eternally so that it, too,
            might remain through the ages.
            In it, I builded my knowledge of "Magic-Science"
            so that I might be here when again I return from Amenti,
            Aye, while I sleep in the Halls of Amenti,
            my Soul roaming free will incarnate,
            dwell among men in this form or another. (Hermes, thrice-born.)
            Emissary on Earth am I of the Dweller,
            fulfilling his commands so many might be lifted.
            Now return I to the halls of Amenti,
            leaving behind me some of my wisdom.
            Preserve ye and keep ye the command of the Dweller:
            Lift ever upwards your eyes toward the light.
            Surely in time, ye are one with the Master,
            surely by right ye are one with the Master,
            surely by right yet are one with the ALL.
            Now, I depart from ye.
            Know my commandments,
            keep them and be them,
            and I will be with you,
            helping and guiding you into the Light.
            Now before me opens the portal.
            Go I down in the darkness of night.  </span>
            <h2>TABLET II</h2>
            <h3>THE HALLS OF AMENTI</h3>
            <span>Deep in Earth's heart lie the Halls of Amenti,
                far 'neath the islands of sunken Atlantis,
                Halls of the Dead and halls of the living,
                bathed in the fire of the infinite ALL.
                Far in a past time, lost in the space time,
                the Children of Light looked down on the world.
                Seeing the children of men in their bondage,
                bound by the force that came from beyond.
                Knew they that only by freedom from bondage
                could man ever rise from the Earth to the Sun.
                Down they descended and created bodies,
                taking the semblance of men as their own.
                The Masters of everything said after their forming:
                "We are they who were formed from the space-dust,
                partaking of life from the infinite ALL;
                living in the world as children of men,
                like and yet unlike the children of men."
                Then for a dwelling place, far 'neath the earth crust,
                blasted great spaces they by their power,
                spaces apart from the children of men.
                Surrounded them by forces and power,
                shielded from harm they the Halls of the Dead.
                Side by side then, placed they other spaces,
                filled them with Life and with Light from above.
                Builded they then the Halls of Amenti,
                that they might dwell eternally there,
                living with life to eternity's end.
                Thirty and two were there of the children,
                sons of Lights who had come among men,
                seeking to free from the bondage of darkness
                those who were bound by the force from beyond.
                Deep in the Halls of Life grew a flower, flaming,
                expanding, driving backward the night.
                Placed in the centre, a ray of great potence, Life
                giving, Light giving, filling with power all who came near it.
                Placed they around it thrones, two and thirty,
                places for each of the Children of Light,
                placed so that they were bathed in the radiance,
                filled with the Life from the eternal Light.
                There time after time placed they their first created bodies
                so that they might by filled with the Spirit of Life.
                One hundred years out of each thousand must the
                Life-giving Light flame forth on their bodies.
                Quickening, awakening the Spirit of Life.
                There in the circle from aeon to aeon,
                sit the Great Masters,
                living a life not known among men.
                There in the Halls of Life they lie sleeping;
                free flows their Soul through the bodies of men.
                Time after time, while their bodies lie sleeping,
                incarnate they in the bodies of men.
                Teaching and guiding onward and upward,
                out of the darkness into the light.
                There in the Hall of Life, filled with their wisdom,
                known not to the races of man, living forever 'neath the cold
                fire of life, sit the Children of Light.
                Times there are when they awaken,
                come from the depths to be lights among men,
                infinite they among finite men.
                He who by progress has grown from the darkness,
                lifted himself from the night into light,
                free is he made of the Halls of Amenti,
                free of the Flower of Light and of Life.
                Guided he then, by wisdom and knowledge,
                passes from men, to the Master of Life.
                There he may dwell as one with the Masters,
                free from the bonds of the darkness of night.
                Seated within the flower of radiance sit seven
                Lords from the Space-Times above us,
                helping and guiding through infinite Wisdom,
                the pathway through time of the children of men.
                Mighty and strange, they,
                veiled with their power,
                silent, all-knowing,drawing the Life force,
                different yet one with the
                children of men.
                Aye, different, and yet One
                with the Children of Light.
                Custodians and watchers of the force of man's bondage,
                ready to loose when the light has been reached.
                First and most mighty,
                sits the Veiled Presence, Lord of Lords,
                the infinite Nine,
                over the other from each
                the Lords of the Cycles;
                Three, Four, Five, and Six, Seven, Eight,
                each with his mission, each with his powers,
                guiding, directing the destiny of man.
                There sit they, mighty and potent,
                free of all time and space.
                Not of this world they,
                yet akin to it,
                Elder Brothers they,
                of the children of men.
                Judging and weighing,
                they with their wisdom,
                watching the progress
                of Light among men.
                There before them was I led by the Dweller,
                watched him blend with ONE from above.
                Then from HE came forth a voice saying:
                "Great art thou, Thoth, among children of men.
                Free henceforth of the Halls of Amenti,
                Master of Life among children of men.
                Taste not of death except as thou will it,
                drink thou of Life to Eternity's end,
                Henceforth forever is Life,
                thine for the taking.
                Henceforth is Death at the call of thy hand.
                Dwell here or leave here when thou desireth,
                free is Amenti to the Sun of man.
                Take thou up Life in what form thou desireth,
                Child of the Light that has grown among men.
                Choose thou thy work, for all should must labor,
                never be free from the pathway of Light.
                One step thou has gained on the long pathway upward,
                infinite now is the mountain of Light.
                Each step thou taketh but heightens the mountain;
                all of thy progress but lengthens the goal.
                Approach ye ever the infinite Wisdom,
                ever before thee recedes the goal.
                Free are ye made now of the Halls of Amenti
                to walk hand in hand with the Lords of the world,
                one in one purpose, working together,
                bring of Light to the children of men."
                Then from his throne came one of the Masters,
                taking my hand and leading me onward,
                through all the Halls of the deep hidden land.
                Led he me through the Halls of Amenti,
                showing the mysteries that are known not to man.
                Through the dark passage, downward he led me,
                into the Hall where site the dark Death.
                Vast as space lay the great Hall before me,
                walled by darkness but yet filled with Light.
                Before me arose a great throne of darkness,
                veiled on it seated a figure of night.
                Darker than darkness sat the great figure,
                dark with a darkness not of the night.
                Before it then paused the Master, speaking
                The Word that brings about Life, saying;
                "Oh, master of darkness,
                guide of the way from Life unto Life,
                before thee I bring a Sun of the morning.
                Touch him not ever with the power of night.
                Call not his flame to the darkness of night.
                Know him, and see him,
                one of our brothers,
                lifted from darkness into the Light.
                Release thou his flame from its bondage,
                free let it flame through the darkness of night."
                Raised then the hand of the figure,
                forth came a flame that grew clear and bright.
                Rolled back swiftly the curtain of darkness,
                unveiled the Hall from the darkness of night.
                Then grew in the great space before me,
                flame after flame, from the veil of the night.
                Uncounted millions leaped they before me,
                some flaming forth as flowers of fire.
                Others there were that shed a dim radiance,
                flowing but faintly from out of the night.
                Some there were that faded swiftly;
                others that grew from a small spark of light.
                Each surrounded by its dim veil of darkness,
                yet flaming with light that could never be quenched.
                Coming and going like fireflies in springtime,
                filled they with space with Light and with Life.
                Then spoke a voice, mighty and solemn, saying:
                "These are lights that are souls among men,
                growing and fading, existing forever,
                changing yet living, through death into life.
                When they have bloomed into flower,
                reached the zenith of growth in their life,
                swiftly then send I my veil of darkness,
                shrouding and changing to new forms of life.
                Steadily upward throughout the ages, growing,
                expanding into yet another flame,
                lighting the darkness with yet greater power,
                quenched yet unquenched by the veil of the night.
                So grows the soul of man ever upward,
                quenched yet unquenched by the darkness of night.
                I, Death, come, and yet I remain not,
                for life eternal exists in the ALL;
                only an obstacle, I in the pathway,
                quick to be conquered by the infinite light.
                Awaken, O flame that burns ever inward,
                flame forth and conquer the veil of the night."
                Then in the midst of the flames
                in the darkness grew there one that
                drove forth the night, flaming, expanding,
                ever brighter, until at last was nothing but Light.
                Then spoke my guide, the voice of the master:
                See your own soul as it grows in the light,
                free now forever from the Lord of the night. 
                Forward he led me through many great spaces
                filled with the mysteries of the Children of Light;
                mysteries that man may never yet know of until
                he, too, is a Sun of the Light.
                Backward then HE led me into the Light
                of the hall of the Light.
                Knelt I then before the great Masters,
                Lords of ALL from the cycles above.
                Spoke HE then with words of great power saying:
                Thou hast been made free of the Halls of Amenti.
                Choose thou thy work among the children of men.
                Then spoke I:
                O, great master,
                let me be a teacher of men,
                leading then onward and upward until they,
                too, are lights among men;
                freed from the veil of the night that surrounds them,
                flaming with light that shall shine among men.
                Spoke to me then the voice:
                Go, as yet will. So be it decreed.
                Master are ye of your destiny,
                free to take or reject at will.
                Take yet the power, take ye the wisdom.
                Shine as a light among the children of men.
                Upward then, led me the Dweller.
                Dwelt I again among children of men,
                teaching and showing some of my wisdom;
                Sun of the Light, a fire among men.
                Now again I tread the path downward,
                seeking the light in the darkness of night.
                Bold ye and keep ye, preserve my record,
                guide shall it be to the children of men.

            <h2>TABLET III</h2>
            <h3>THE KEY OF WISDOM</h3>
            <span>I, Thoth, the Atlantean,
                give of my wisdom,
                give of my knowledge,
                give of my power.
                Freely I give to the children of men.
                Give that they, too, might have wisdom
                to shine through the world from the veil of the night.
                
                Wisdom is power and power is wisdom,
                one with each other, perfecting the whole. 

                Be thou not proud, O man, in thy wisdom.
                Discourse with the ignorant as well as the wise.
                If one comes to thee full of knowledge,
                listen and heed, for wisdom is all. 

                Keep thou not silent when evil is spoken for Truth
                like the sunlight shines above all.
                He who over-steppeth the Law shall be punished,
                for only through Law comes the freedom of men.
                Cause thou not fear for fear is a bondage,
                a fetter that binds the darkness to men. 

                Follow thine heart during thy lifetime.
                Do thou more than is commanded of thee.
                When thou hast gained riches,
                follow thou thine heart,
                for all these are of no avail if
                thine heart be weary.
                Diminish thou not the time of
                following thine heart.
                It is abhorred of the soul. 

                They that are guided go not astray,
                but they that are lost cannot find a straight path.
                If thou go among men, make for thyself,
                Love, the beginning and end of the heart.

                If one cometh unto thee for council,
                let him speak freely,
                that the thing for which he hath
                come to thee may be done.
                If he hesitates to open his heart to thee,
                it is because thou, the judge, doeth the wrong.

                Repeat thou not extravagant speech,
                neither listen thou to it,
                for it is the utterance of one
                not in equilibrium.
                Speak thou not of it,
                so that he before thee may know wisdom.

                Silence is of great profit.
                An abundance of speech profiteth nothing.
                Exalt not thine heart above the children of men,
                lest it be brought lower than the dust.

                If thou be great among men,
                be honoured for knowledge and gentleness.
                If thou seeketh to know the nature of a friend,
                ask not his companion,
                but pass a time alone with him.
                Debate with him,
                testing his heart by his words and his bearing.

                That which goeth into the store-house must come forth,
                and the things that are thine must be shared with a friend.

                Knowledge is regarded by the fool as ignorance,
                and the things that are profitable are to him hurtful.
                He liveth in death.
                It is therefore his food. 

                The wise man lets his heart overflow
                but keeps silent his mouth.
                O man, list to the voice of wisdom;
                list to the voice of light. 

                Mysteries there are in the Cosmos
                that unveiled fill the world with their light.
                Let he who would be free from the bonds of darkness
                first divine the material from the immaterial,
                the fire from the earth;
                for know ye that as earth descends to earth,
                so also fire ascends unto
                fire and becomes one with fire.
                He who knows the fire that is within
                himself shall ascend unto the eternal fire
                and dwell in it eternally.
                Fire, the inner fire,
                is the most potent of all force,
                for it overcomethall things and
                penetrates to all things of the Earth.
                Man supports himself only on that which resists.
                So Earth must resist man else he existeth not. 

                All eyes do not see with the same vision,
                for to one an object appears of
                one form and colour
                and to a different eye of another.
                So also the infinite fire,
                changing from colour to colour,
                is never the same from day to day. 

                Thus, speak I, THOTH, of my wisdom,
                for a man is a fire burning bright
                through the night;
                never is quenched in the veil of the darkness,
                never is quenched by the veil of the night. 

                Into men's hearts, I looked by my wisdom,
                found them not free from the bondage of strife.
                Free from the toils, thy fire, O my brother,
                lest it be buried in the shadow of night! 

                Hark ye, O man, and list to this wisdom:
                where do name and form cease?
                Only in consciousness, invisible,
                an infinite force of radiance bright.
                The forms that ye create by brightening
                they vision are truly effects that follow thy cause. 

                Man is a star bound to a body,
                until in the end,
                he is freed through his strife.
                Only by struggle and toiling thy
                utmost shall the star within thee
                bloom out in new life.
                He who knows the commencement of all things,
                free is his star from the realm of night. 

                Remember, O man, that all which exists
                is only another form of that which exists not.
                Everything that has being is passing into yet other
                being and thou thyself are not an exception. 

                Consider the Law, for all is Law.
                Seek not that which is not of the Law,
                for such exists only in the illusions of the senses.
                Wisdom cometh to all her children
                even as they cometh unto wisdom. 
                
                All through the ages,
                the light has been hidden.
                Awake, O man, and be wise
                
                Deep in the mysteries of life have I traveled,
                seeking and searching for that which is hidden
                
                List ye, O man, and be wise.
                Far 'neath the earth crust,
                in the Halls of Amenti,
                mysteries I saw that are hidden from men. 

                Oft have I journeyed the deep hidden passage,
                looked on the Light that is Life among men.
                There 'neath the flowers of Life ever living,
                searched I the hearts and the secrets of men.
                Found I that man is but living in darkness,
                light of the great fire is hidden within. 

                Before the Lords of hidden Amenti
                learned I the wisdom I give unto men. 
                 
                Masters are they of the great Secret Wisdom,
                brought from the future of infinity's end.
                Seven are they, the Lords of Amenti,
                overlords they of the Children of Morning,
                Suns of the cycles, Masters of Wisdom. 

                Formed are not they as the children of men?
                THREE, FOUR, FIVE AND SIX, SEVEN,
                EIGHT, NINE are the titles of the Masters of men. 

                Far from the future, formless yet forming,
                came they as teachers for the children of men.
                Live they forever, yet not of the living,
                bound not to life and yet free from death. 

                Rule they forever with infinite wisdom,
                bound yet not bound to the dark Halls of Death.
                Life they have in them, yet life that is not life,
                free from all are the Lords of the ALL. 

                Forth from them came forth the Logos,
                instruments they of the power o'er all.
                Vast is their countenance,
                yet hidden in smallness,
                formed by a forming, known yet unknown. 

                THREE holds the key of all hidden magic,
                creator he of the halls of the Dead;
                sending forth power, shrouding with darkness,
                binding the souls of the children of men;
                sending the darkness, binding the soul force;
                director of negative to the children of men. 

                FOUR is he who looses the power.
                Lord, he, of Life to the children of men.
                Light is his body, flame is his countenance;
                freer of souls to the children of men. 

                FIVE is the master, the Lord of all magic -
                Key to The Word that resounds among men. 

                SIX is the Lord of Light, the hidden pathway,
                path of the souls of the children of men. 

                SEVEN is he who is Lord of the vastness,
                master of Space and the key of the Times. 

                EIGHT is he who orders the progress;
                weighs and balances the journey of men. 

                NINE is the father, vast he of countenance,
                forming and changing from out of the formless. 

                Meditate on the symbols I give thee.
                Keys are they, though hidden from men. 

                Reach ever upward, O Soul of the morning.
                Turn thy thoughts upward to Light and to Life.
                Find in the keys of the numbers I bring thee,
                light on the pathway from life unto life. 

                Place in thy body a thought-formed picture.
                Think of the numbers that lead thee to Life. 

                Clear is the pathway to he who has wisdom.
                Open the door to the Kingdom of Light. 

                Pour forth thy flame as a Sun of the morning.
                Shut out the darkness and live in the day. 

                Take thee, O man! As part of thy being,
                the Seven who are but are not as they seem.
                Opened, O man! Have I my wisdom.
                Follow the path in the way I have led. 

                Masters of Wisdom,
                SUN of the MORNING LIGHT and LIFE
                to the children of men.

            <h2>TABLET IV</h2>
            <h3>THE SPACE BORN</h3>
            <span>List ye, O man, to the voice of wisdom,
                list to the voice of THOTH, the Atlantean.

                Freely I give to thee of my wisdom,
                gathered from the time and space of this cycle;
                master of mysteries, SUN of the morning,
                living forever, a child of the LIGHT,
                shining with brightness, star of the morning, 

                THOTH the teacher of men, is of ALL.
                Long time ago, I in my childhood,
                lay 'neath the stars on long-buried ATLANTIS,
                dreaming of mysteries far above men. 

                Then in my heart grew there a great longing to
                conquer the pathway that led to the stars.
                Year after year, I sought after wisdom,
                seeking new knowledge, following the way,
                until at last my SOUL, in great travail,
                broke from its bondage and bounded away. 
                
                Free was I from the bondage of earth-men.
                Free from the body, I flashed through the night.
                Unlocked at last for me was the star-space.
                Free was I from the bondage of night.
                Now to the end of space sought I wisdom,
                far beyond knowledge of finite man. 

                Far into space, my SOUL traveled freely
                into infinity's circle of light.
                Strange, beyond knowledge, were some of the planets,
                great and gigantic, beyond dreams of men. 

                Yet found I Law, in all of its beauty, working
                through and among them as here among men. 

                Flashed forth my soul through infinity's beauty,
                far through space
                I flew with my thoughts. 

                Rested I there on a planet of beauty. 
                Strains of harmony filled all the air. 

                Shapes there were, moving in Order,
                great and majestic as stars in the night;
                mounting in harmony, ordered equilibrium,
                symbols of the Cosmic, like unto Law. 

                Many the stars I passed in my journey,
                many the races of men on their worlds;
                some reaching high as stars of the morning,
                some falling low in the blackness of night. 

                Each and all of them struggling upward,
                gaining the heights and plumbing the depths,
                moving at times in realms of brightness,
                living through darkness, gaining the Light. 

                Know, O man, that Light is thine heritage.
                Know that darkness is only a veil.
                Sealed in thine heart is brightness eternal,
                waiting the moment of freedom to conquer,
                waiting to rend the veil of the night. 

                Some I found who had conquered the ether.
                Free of space were they while yet they were men.
                Using the force that is the foundation of ALL things,
                far in space constructed they a planet,
                drawn by the force that flows through the ALL;
                condensing, coalescing the ether into forms,
                that grew as they willed. 

                Outstripping in science, they, all of the races,
                mighty in wisdom, sons of the stars.
                Long time I paused, watching their wisdom.
                Saw them create from out of the ether cities
                gigantic of rose and gold.
                Formed forth from the primal element,
                base of all matter, the ether far flung. 

                Far in the past, they had conquered the ether,
                freed themselves from the bondage of toil;
                formed in heir mind only a picture and swiftly
                created, it grew. 

                Forth then, my soul sped, throughout the Cosmos,
                seeing ever, new things and old;
                learning that man is truly space-born,
                a Sun of the Sun,
                a child of the stars.

                Know ye, O man, whatever from ye inhabit,
                surely it is one with the stars. 

                Thy bodies are nothing but planets revolving
                around their central suns. 
                
            </span>
